Come and join us for the Open Mozilla Night. This meetup focuses on getting you
started for your first contribution to any Mozilla project of your choice (see below)
and gives you a space to continue your contributions among other Mozillians.

You can contribute in a variety of ways:

* Firefox development
* WebExtensions
* Servo (parallel browser engine project)
* Rust (new systems programming language)
* Translation
* MDN
* Policy and advocacy
* Any other Mozilla project

Join us if you like help getting started, continue to work on a Mozilla project or just
have a chat with community members.

Please bring your laptop. Drinks will be provided.
